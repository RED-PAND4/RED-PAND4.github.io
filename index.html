      <p><strong>Authors: </strong> Aloisi Deborah & Giaretta Leonardo</p>

<p>This project resulted from the 2024/2025 Knowledge Graph Engineering class of Prof. Fausto Giunchiglia at UniTn.</p>


<p>This page describes the process and outcome of the engineering of a knowledge graph about “KnowDive Research Group”. 
    The graph consists of a knowledge layer and a data layer.
    Entities are instances of the E-type classes, which have their own data properties, as well as object properties which connect them.

    The project has been implemented following the <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2105.09418">iTelos</a> methodology 
    which provides a schema to follow implementing phase after phase and achieving intermediate and eventually final results. 
    This is done with the aim to not only create a graph for the specific case in hand, but to also allow for potential reuse and expansion.

<h3 id="purpose-and-domain-of-interest">Purpose and Domain of Interest</h3>
The main purpose of this project as expressed by the final user is the following:

"A service which helps the users to query and know about all the products and the people that are working or were working in the Knowdive research group at the University of Trento"

<h3 id="Layers">Layers</h3>
This project evaluate the following layers of the iTelos methodology:
<p>• <strong>Language Layer:</strong> any linguistic resource - property or dataset about languages and terms
used - should be explicitly referenced to increase re-usability.</p>

<p>• <strong>Knowledge Layer:</strong> any Knowledge Base encoding information about KG schemas (etypes
and properties). If detailed enough, this layer could be decomposed in its core elements:
ontology and teleology, thus giving the user an unprecedented insight into the conceptual
and relational data shaping behind the actual data values representation.</p>

<p>• <strong>Data layer:</strong> any dataset which consists of data in some format, instantiating the KG’s struc-
ture (entities and attributes).</p>

<h3 id="Language-Resources">Language Resources</h3>
<p>Language resources are essential for the project, as they allow the user to understand the data and the language layer. 
    In this project, we have used the following language resources:</p> 
    <p>• <strong>LiveDataUNITN: </strong><a href="https://datascientiafoundation.github.io/LiveDataUNITN/datasets/DU-UNITN-language/">DU-UNITN-Language</a></p>
    <p>• <strong>KRG-UNITN Language: </strong>the dataset is created for collecting and describing the term used into the  data of the Knowdive Research Group.</p>

<h3 id="Knowledge-Resources">Knowledge Resources</h3>
<p>Knowledge resources are essential for the project, as they allow the user to understand the data and the knowledge layer. 
    In this project, we have used the following knowledge resources:</p> 
    <p>• <strong>Digital University Ontology: </strong><a href="https://datascientiafoundation.github.io/LiveDataUNITN/datasets/DU-UNITN-ontology/">DU-UNITN-ontology</a></p>
    <p>• <strong>VIVO Core Ontology</strong><a href="http://liveschema.eu/dataset/lov_vivo">VIVO</a></p>
    <p>• <strong>Academic Institution Internal Structure Ontology: </strong><a href="http://liveschema.eu/dataset/lov_aiiso">AIISO</a></p>
    <p>• <strong>Semantic Web for Research Communities: </strong><a href="http://liveschema.eu/dataset/lov_swrc">SWRC</a></p>






<p>If users are interested in expanding data resources, they can
use the already existing schemas as meaningful anchors, without loosing data quality.
Data Scientia users should have access to both projects and their layers and decide what to
re-use, modify or produce to meet the purpose they have in mind. Projects should be linked
based on their similarities on a general and layered basis.
Metadata play a crucial role in this context because they describe datasets and repre-
sent the connections between them, making resources findable and addressable without any
effort. For example, users looking for healthcare ontologies should be able to access them
directly, without having to go through whole projects at the risk of stepping away from their
purpose. Metadata reduces search time and space: they allow users to skip to what is essential
to them, making the Data Scientia successful and meaningful.
Our project purpose can now be stated unambiguously:</p>

<p><em>A KG supporting the Data Scientia web portal’s users to find the most suitable resource
for their needs, as well as all the resources linked by the one searched.</em></p>

<p>To achieve the project objective, we have analyzed existing KGE Projects and Data Scientia resources and projects, which were our data resources. We have extracted the
fundamental layered view of datasets from KGE Projects and we have outlined Data Scientia main entity types, along with their properties, by carefully examining the web portal and through
a Data Scientia top level description and requirements given to us by the domain expert. The
latter helped us understanding the preliminary boundaries of our schema resources, by stating
the present structure of the portal with its shortcomings: the absence of linked resources and
informational layers. To overcome them, we have designed a possible and plausible future
structure for the Data Scientia web portal, by defining its Knowledge Graph.</p>

    explain how we managed to produce our KG using the iTelos metodology.</p>
